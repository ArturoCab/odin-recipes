		<p><h2>Description</h2><br>
			This pistachio pesto pasta with shrimp begins with a basil-pistachio pesto—you are likely familiar with pesto made with pine nuts, but pesto is very flexible, and you can use almost any nut.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					2 tablespoons raw pistachios, without shells
				</li>
				<li>
					
					1 1/2 cups fresh basil leaves
				</li>
				<li>
					1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
				</li>	
				<li>
					1/3 cup olive oil
				</li>
				<li>1 garlic clove, peeled</li>
				<li>1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)</li>
				<li>freshly-squeezed lemon juice to taste</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p><h2>Directions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>For pesto, place a skillet over medium-high heat, and toast pistachios until fragrant, tossing frequently, about 1 minute. Remove pistachios to a plate to cool completely, about 10 minutes.</li>
				<li>Combine pistachios, basil, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, and garlic in a blender or food processor and purée until smooth. Season to taste with salt and lemon juice.</li>
				<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Reserve 1 tablespoon pasta water; drain.</li>
				<li>Gently stir 1/4 cup pesto into pasta with a slotted spoon.</li>
				<li>Add shrimp, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper to a bowl. Toss to thoroughly coat shrimp in seasonings.</li>
				<li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add butter; once melted, add shrimp to the skillet in a single even layer. Cook shrimp on one side until seared, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip shrimp and cook until shrimp is seared, pink, and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
				<li>Add shrimp to pasta. Add reserved pasta water if needed to thin sauce, and serve.</li>
			</ol>
